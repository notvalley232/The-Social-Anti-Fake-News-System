## Project Overview

This anti-fake news system has successfully implemented all the required functionalities for the course project, utilizing the knowledge and technologies learned in class. All team members actively participated in the development process, contributing their expertise to create a comprehensive solution for combating misinformation. To focus more on system development and functionality, we used AI to generate mock data for testing purposes, which has been deployed in the team leader's GitHub repository at https://github.com/notvalley232/The-Social-Anti-Fake-News-System. Apart from the mock data generation, all other aspects of the project were completed entirely by our team members without AI assistance. We only consulted AI models or searched online for information when we needed to recall forgotten concepts or learn new technologies during the development process.
